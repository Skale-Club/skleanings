# Milestones

## v11.0 Password Reset (Shipped: 2026-05-14)

**Phases completed:** 1 phase (47), 3 plans, all complete

**Key accomplishments:**

- `password_reset_tokens` table (SHA-256 hash, expiresAt, usedAt) + 4 IStorage methods (`createPasswordResetToken`, `findPasswordResetToken`, `markPasswordResetTokenUsed`, `updateUserPassword`)
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` (always 200 — no enumeration), `POST /api/auth/reset-password` (token validation + bcrypt update + mark used), `POST /api/auth/change-password` (session-guarded, verifies current password)
- `buildPasswordResetEmail(resetUrl, companyName)` — branded Resend template with tenant company name from companySettings
- `ForgotPassword.tsx` + `ResetPassword.tsx` pages; "Forgot password?" link in AdminLogin; routes wired in App.tsx

## v10.0 Tenant Admin Auth (Shipped: 2026-05-14)

**Phases completed:** 2 phases (45–46), 3 plans, all complete

**Key accomplishments:**

- `SessionData.adminUser` extended with optional `tenantId` field; `requireAdmin` adds cross-tenant 403 guard — session.tenantId must match res.locals.tenant.id
- `POST /api/auth/tenant-login` — timing-safe bcrypt with DUMMY_HASH fallback, stores tenantId in session; `GET /api/auth/admin-me` returns session identity; `POST /api/auth/logout` destroys session
- `AdminTenantAuthContext` — calls GET /api/auth/admin-me on mount, stores `{ isAuthenticated, tenantId, email, role }` with no hardcoded tenant references
- `AdminLogin.tsx` rewritten to POST /api/auth/tenant-login (Supabase removed); `Admin.tsx` redirect guard via `useAdminTenantAuth`; `App.tsx` wraps admin routes in `AdminTenantAuthProvider`

---

## v9.0 Tenant Onboarding (Shipped: 2026-05-14)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases (42–44), 8 plans, all complete

**Key accomplishments:**

- IStorage extended with 6 global-registry methods (getTenants, createTenant, updateTenantStatus, getTenantDomains, addDomain, removeDomain) — all use `db` directly, no tenantId scoping
- 6 super-admin API routes (GET/POST /tenants, PATCH status, GET/POST/DELETE /domains) with 409 conflict guards, hostname normalization, isPrimary delete protection
- React Query hooks + `TenantsSection` + `ManageDomainsDialog` in SuperAdmin.tsx — full tenant/domain CRUD without page reloads
- `users.password` migration + `provisionTenantAdmin` (db.transaction) + `seedTenantCompanySettings` (onConflictDoNothing) storage methods
- `POST /api/super-admin/tenants/:id/provision` — bcrypt hash + randomBytes credential, one-time display in ProvisionDialog, companySettings auto-seeded on tenant creation
- `invalidateTenantCache(hostname)` exported from tenant.ts — called on domain add/remove so LRU reflects changes without server restart
- 503 guard in `resolveTenantMiddleware` for inactive tenants — fires before any route handler
- Per-tenant stats (bookings/services/staff) via `Promise.all` aggregates in GET /tenants — rendered as 3 columns in TenantsSection table

## v8.0 Multi-Tenant Architecture (Shipped: 2026-05-13)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases (38–41), 10 plans, all complete
**Files changed:** 81 files, +5969 / -457 lines

**Key accomplishments:**

- Multi-tenant schema: tenants, domains, user_tenants registry tables + tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 on all 40 business tables via idempotent Supabase CLI migration; Skleanings seeded as tenant id=1
- Drizzle schema updated with tenants/domains/userTenants declarations and tenantId field on all 40 business tables — full TypeScript type coverage for multi-tenant queries
- `DatabaseStorage.forTenant(tenantId)` static factory pattern — 220 `this.tenantId` references across all 23 method groups; `export const storage = DatabaseStorage.forTenant(1)` singleton preserves zero route breakage
- `server/middleware/tenant.ts` with LRU cache (500 entries, 5-min TTL) resolves hostname → tenant → scoped storage instance; unknown hostnames return 404; super-admin routes bypass entirely
- All 11 `server/lib/` files refactored to accept `IStorage` as explicit parameter; all 24 business route files migrated from global `import { storage }` to `res.locals.storage`
- `infra/` directory: Caddyfile (wildcard `*.xkedule.com` TLS via xcaddy cloudflare plugin), app.service (systemd, Restart=always), deploy.yml (workflow_dispatch SSH to Hetzner), README.md (8-step CX23 setup guide)
