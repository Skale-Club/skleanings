## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 09: DB connection stabilized via postgres.js (SCRAM/pgBouncer fix) — database layer is reliable
- v1.0 start: Two-table design chosen (visitor_sessions + conversion_events) with denormalized attribution snapshot at event time
- v1.0 start: Dual-row first-touch + last-touch writes on booking_completed event — avoids SQL CASE branching in reports
- v1.0 start: localStorage UUID (not sessionStorage) — must survive multi-day booking journeys
- v1.0 start: ATTR-03 placed in Phase 10 (schema) not Phase 11 — unique constraint must exist before any conversion writes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Rate limiting strategy for POST /api/analytics/session (public endpoint) — not yet designed; address in Phase 10 planning
- GoHighLevel custom field names for UTM sync — must be confirmed before Phase 13 plan execution
