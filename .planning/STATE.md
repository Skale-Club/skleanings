# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** Customers can discover, book, and pay for cleaning services online without calling — and the business can manage everything from one admin panel.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — Schema, Capture & Classification

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (Schema, Capture & Classification) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 10
Last activity: 2026-04-25 -- Phase 10 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 09: DB connection stabilized via postgres.js (SCRAM/pgBouncer fix) — database layer is reliable
- v1.0 start: Two-table design chosen (visitor_sessions + conversion_events) with denormalized attribution snapshot at event time
- v1.0 start: Dual-row first-touch + last-touch writes on booking_completed event — avoids SQL CASE branching in reports
- v1.0 start: localStorage UUID (not sessionStorage) — must survive multi-day booking journeys
- v1.0 start: ATTR-03 placed in Phase 10 (schema) not Phase 11 — unique constraint must exist before any conversion writes
- [Phase 10-schema-capture-classification]: visitorSessions defined BEFORE bookings in schema.ts (required for FK forward-reference)
- [Phase 10-schema-capture-classification]: ATTR-03 partial unique index enforced via SQL migration only — Drizzle 0.39.3 cannot express partial unique indexes
- [Phase 10-schema-capture-classification]: Types/schemas collocated with table definitions (contacts pattern), not moved to bottom TYPES block

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **MIGRATION PENDING** — `supabase/migrations/20260425000000_add_utm_tracking.sql` is written and ready. Needs `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` (direct connection URL) in `.env` to apply. Get from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database > Direct connection (port 5432). Then run `supabase db push` from the project root. Plan 10-02 TypeScript types are already available (shared/schema.ts compiles), but Plan 10-02 execution requires the DB tables to exist before the storage/endpoint can be tested.
- Rate limiting strategy for POST /api/analytics/session (public endpoint) — not yet designed; address in Phase 10 planning
- GoHighLevel custom field names for UTM sync — must be confirmed before Phase 13 plan execution
